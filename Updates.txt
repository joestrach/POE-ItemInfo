The following is a list of what has been updated, starting with 1.9.3.
Current Script Caretaker: aRTy42

2.4.02
================================
from aRTy42
Updated Uniques.
Maps have updated Boss descriptions, general notes and ratings for difficulty (1-5) and layout (A-C).

2.4.01
================================
from aRTy42
Compiled new map info from various sources, see the forum thread for details.
Updated Divinations cards with wiki information.
Uniques not updated yet, because there are lots of things to fix and holding back
	the map update until everything is done seemed stupid.

2.4.00
================================
from aRTy42
Basic support for the new value range format ("#-#" was changed to "# to #"). The script will continue to display its results as before.
Map and Divination card information was not updated yet. This will follow in a few days once there is enough on the wiki.
Fixed how the "AdditionalMacros" file was included to support shortcuts to the script from the start menu and task bar.

2.3.07
================================
from aRTy42
New feature: Gem quality info. Full 20% quality effect and effect per quality point get displayed.
Completely restructured jewels: Separated both the affix parsing code and the data files.
	This change should have no visible impact ingame. Please report bugs if you notice any.
Corrected a few value ranges and detection errors for jewels. Legacy Crit Multiplier for jewels in standard did not get a special
	detection though, you will get something like "n/a (0) <new value range> T0" there.
Added Tora crafts "increased Trap and Mine damage" and "increased Trap Throwing and Mine Laying Speed"
Updated Divination Cards with wiki infos

2.3.06
================================
from aRTy42
The new label "Map Drop" introduced in PoE v2.3.2 is now accounted for and thus no longer breaks parsing items.
Added new file "AdditionalMacros.txt" in the main folder. The user macros that used to be at the very end of the ahk-file
	are now located here, for easier access. Added detection for the Steam version exe-file. The user macros are disabled
	by default, if you want to learn more about them, check the opening post in the forum thread.
Removed script function "Valuable Evaluation", meaning uniques and gems are no longer tagged as "Valuable" in the
	last line, which was controlled via txt files. Lootfilters fulfill this role nowadays.
	Similarly, drop only gems are no longer tagged, also because lootfilters and since there are almost none since
	gems became available from vendors. If you miss one of these functions, please give feedback in the forum thread.
DPS display: Fixed how additional ele/chaos damage was detected. It used to break for certain mods, which made the section display blanks.
Fixed Divination Card detection that got broken with PoE v2.3.2 (the game now labels them with "Rarity: Divination Card"
	instead of "Rarity: Normal")
Fixed "Stun Recovery" that got renamed to "Stun and Block Recovery" with PoE v2.3.2.
Updated Uniques, Maps, Divination Cards with wiki infos

2.3.04
================================
from Underbent, magus424
Major update to the maps data file, thanks to yet another data script from Underbent
	This should fix incorrect map vendoring information and give more divination card drop infos.
Added Shavronne's Gambit to uniques, which was still missing (pointed out by magus424)

2.3.03
================================
from aRTy42
Uniques: Included more of the new 2.3 uniques. Updated implicits for Sceptres and Wands.
	Manually adjusted the display for a few more uniques (notable: Ventor's Gamble and several Jewels)
Updated Divination Cards
Updated Maps

2.3.02
================================
from underbent, vdorie, aRTy42
Improved data thanks to underbent's additions to the data fetch script: https://github.com/underbent/scrape_poe_info
	This means divination cards are now updated to today's wiki infos
	and uniques with decimal point values (like 0.2% leech) no longer truncate the displayed value to 0
Manually cleaned up the display for uniques with style variants (Doryani's Invitation, Atziri's Splendour, Vessel of Vinktar)
The modifier/text column for uniques is now 10 characters wider than for other items (if truncation is used, which is the default),
	as uniques don't need the space for displaying mod tiers but tend to have longer or more complicated wording.
Included a fix from vdorie to how the base level of blue items was determined
Included a fix from underbent so that the warning info of equipped items that you no longer meet the requirements for is not
	displayed in the info script window anymore

2.3.01
================================
from aRTy42
Added "Has Fated Variant" line to info for respective uniques
"Max Sockets" should no longer show up on non armour/weapon items
Fixed Drillneck data that got lost due to an odd wiki entry

=================================
Fixed typo in FlaskChargesUsed

2.0 Jewel Support by XiMMiX
=================================
I've added support for jewels to the script.

There is a known problem with the suffix count in those cases where we don't know if the item has 1 or 2 suffixes. At the moment the output says the item has 2 suffixes but it should be "1 or 2". But otherwise the code should work.

The second problem is that I haven't yet been able to test very much, especially the complex affixes. I'm planning to test all edge cases with complex affixes, but would appreciate any help with testing the simple affixes.
